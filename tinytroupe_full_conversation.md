Jordan acts: [THINK] 
> I'm currently testing a new productivity app layout. I need to evaluate its design based on navigation, visual clarity, feature accessibility, and overall user experience. I should focus on one specific improvement to suggest.
Liam acts: [TALK] 
> I think the new productivity app layout is quite clean and visually appealing, but I found the navigation a bit confusing. It would be great to have a more intuitive menu structure that allows users to access features more easily. Maybe adding a tab bar at the bottom could help with that?
Ava acts: [TALK] 
> I think the new productivity app layout is quite clean and minimal, which I appreciate. However, I found the navigation a bit confusing at times. One specific improvement I would suggest is to make the main features more accessible by adding a bottom navigation bar. This would allow users to quickly switch between key sections without having to go back to the main menu each time.
Liam acts: [DONE] 
Ava acts: [DONE] 
Jordan acts: [TALK] 
> I've been testing the new productivity app layout, and I think the navigation could use some improvement. It feels a bit cluttered, which makes it hard to find features quickly. I suggest simplifying the navigation bar by grouping similar features together and using clearer icons to enhance visual clarity. This should improve the overall user experience.
